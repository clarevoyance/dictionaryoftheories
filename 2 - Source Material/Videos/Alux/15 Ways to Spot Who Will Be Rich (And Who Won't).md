- These people seldom drink, smoke, or party
- They talk about money as freedom, rather than what they can buy with it
- They are very comfortable with inconvenience and discomfort
- They have this blind belief in their ideas and plans
- A luxury lifestyle just doesn't appeal to them
- They start lots of small ventures and don't sweat if they don't work out
- They think in decades, not days
- They prefer creation over consumption
- They're obsessed with their work
- They pursue financial stability at all costs -- and before riches
- They have always had multiple jobs
- They focus 100% on their strengths and ignore their weaknesses
- They don't get embarrassed easily
- Every thought is followed up with immediate action
- They fear being stuck far more than they do failing
