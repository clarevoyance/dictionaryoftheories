Between 1645 and 1715, there is thought to have been a dramatic drop in the sun spot activity on the sun, as recognized by the British solar astronomer Edward Walter Maunder (1851 - 1928)

The theory was confirmed by the American solar physicist Jack Eddy in 1976, from historical records of naked eye observations, auroral records and reports of solar eclipses. This sun spot minimum coincides with the Little Ice Age and suggests a causative relationship.
