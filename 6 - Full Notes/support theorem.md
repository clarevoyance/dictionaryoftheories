One of the key geometric ideas in [[functional analysis]]. If a convex subset $C$ of a real Banach space has a non-empty interior then any point $x$ on the boundary is a *support point* (see also [[Bishop-Phelps theorem]]). In other words,there is a supporting hyperplane (geometrically a tangent) to $C$ at $x$.

This result is fundamental in [[optimization theory]] for example since it leads to the existence of sub-gradients of convex functions, which in turn correspond to [[Lagrange multipliers]] in such results as the [[Karush-Kuhn-Tucker theorem]] or to dual solutions in the [[Fenchel duality theorem]].
