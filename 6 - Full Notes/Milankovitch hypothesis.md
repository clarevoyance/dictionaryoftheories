Proposed by the Yugoslavian geophysicist M. Milankovitch (1879-1958), this theory evaluated the change in solar radiation which would be received by the Earth as a consequence of its own and the Sun's changing orbits.

These changes are primarily cycles of c.21,000 years (precession of the Spring point), c.41,000 years (tilt of the Earth's axis), and c.97,000 years (change in eccentricity of the Earth's path). Milankovitch's model is now widely accepted as accounting for climate change during the last few hundred thousand years and it may explain the Ice Ages of the last 2 million years.

There is also increasing evidence for the effects of such a cyclicity in the remote geological past.
