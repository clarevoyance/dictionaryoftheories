### Mathematics
The branch of mathematics, pioneered in the early 20th century by D. Hilbert, S Banach, J von Neumann and others, which studies functions as elements of large vector spaces (in particular Banach spaces) by analogy with calculus and geometry in $n$-dimensional Euclidean space.

Typical directions include the relationships between the space $X$ and the dual space $X*$ of continuous linear functionals on $X$, and operators between spaces. 

Standard tools include geometric-analytic results like the [[support theorem]], the [[Bishop-Phelps theorem]], the [[Eberlein-Smulyan theorem]], and the [[James's theorem]]. 

The functional analytic framework is crucial in many areas of abstract [[optimization theory]] like the [[calculus of variations, optimal control]]
