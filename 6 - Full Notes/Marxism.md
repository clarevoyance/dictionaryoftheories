Theories derived from the work of [[Marx, Karl (1818-1883)]]

The influence of Marx and of Marxism may be judged from the fact that Marxism has been compared, in its enormous variety, to Christianity. Starting points, though not conclusions, for Marxism are an understanding of history as moved by [[class struggle]] of economic classes as the principal components of society; of politics as derived from clashes of economic [[interests]]; of capitalism as a system which denies fundamental human aspirations.
