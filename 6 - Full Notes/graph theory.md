A graph is a collection of points called vertices, some pairs of which are connected by edges. The study of graphs, an area of [[combinatorics]] dates back to at least to the famous [[Konigsberg bridge problem]], solved by [[Euler, Leonhard (1707-1783)]] which asks for a circuit through the vertices of a given graph.

Other typical questions include finding matchings (collections of vertex-disjoint edges); coverings (collections of vertices including at least one of each edge; see also [[Konig's theorem]]); colorings, as in the famous four color problem which asks whether an arbitrary map can be colored with four colors so countries sharing borders have distinct colors; and [[embedding]] questions

Numerous applications include, for example, the traveling salesman problem and network flow models in combinatorial [[optimization theory]]
